# WordleSolver
Program: Primitive Wordle solver. 

	Instructions: 
	1) Access a wordle game online (read instructions online if unsure how to play). 
	2) On BASH terminal type command (./comp.sh)
	3) Enter your guess on wordle, look at the color sequence you get
	4) Enter your guess in the terminal (all caps) followed by a sequence of B/O/G where 
	   B = black, O = Orange / Yellow, and G = Green. You should see word recommendations given
	   Repeat 3 & 4.
	
	5) Enjoy the game :) {Should be self explanatory}

	Logic: Basic idea of combining letter frequency of remaining valid words and commonly used in  
	       english language

	Just a fun idea I had :)
